# This is the Natural Docs topics file for this project.  If you change anything
# here, it will apply to THIS PROJECT ONLY.  If you'd like to change something
# for all your projects, edit the Topics.txt in Natural Docs' Config directory
# instead.


# If you'd like to prevent keywords from being recognized by Natural Docs, you
# can do it like this:
# Ignore Keywords: [keyword], [keyword], ...
#
# Or you can use the list syntax like how they are defined:
# Ignore Keywords:
#    [keyword]
#    [keyword], [plural keyword]
#    ...


#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SYNTAX:
#
# Topic Type: [name]
# Alter Topic Type: [name]
#    Creates a new topic type or alters one from the main file.  Each type gets
#    its own index and behavior settings.  Its name can have letters, numbers,
#    spaces, and these charaters: - / . '
#
# Plural: [name]
#    Sets the plural name of the topic type, if different.
#
# Keywords:
#    [keyword]
#    [keyword], [plural keyword]
#    ...
#    Defines or adds to the list of keywords for the topic type.  They may only
#    contain letters, numbers, and spaces and are not case sensitive.  Plural
#    keywords are used for list topics.  You can redefine keywords found in the
#    main topics file.
#
# Index: [yes|no]
#    Whether the topics get their own index.  Defaults to yes.  Everything is
#    included in the general index regardless of this setting.
#
# Scope: [normal|start|end|always global]
#    How the topics affects scope.  Defaults to normal.
#    normal        - Topics stay within the current scope.
#    start         - Topics start a new scope for all the topics beneath it,
#                    like class topics.
#    end           - Topics reset the scope back to global for all the topics
#                    beneath it.
#    always global - Topics are defined as global, but do not change the scope
#                    for any other topics.
#
# Class Hierarchy: [yes|no]
#    Whether the topics are part of the class hierarchy.  Defaults to no.
#
# Page Title If First: [yes|no]
#    Whether the topic's title becomes the page title if it's the first one in
#    a file.  Defaults to no.
#
# Break Lists: [yes|no]
#    Whether list topics should be broken into individual topics in the output.
#    Defaults to no.
#
# Can Group With: [type], [type], ...
#    Defines a list of topic types that this one can possibly be grouped with.
#    Defaults to none.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
